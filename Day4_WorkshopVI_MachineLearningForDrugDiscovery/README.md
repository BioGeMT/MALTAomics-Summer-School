## Particals

All code supplied for these sessions are provided as Jupyter Notebooks.  These may be run either locally (on your laptop or desktop) or, experimentally, on Google Colab.

### Google Colab

The following notebooks should open in Google Colab by using the below link provided. Note that each of these notebooks sets up its own environment (this takes a while, please have patience).

+ Practical 1 ‒ Molecular Representation (Open in Colab)
+ Practical 2 ‒ Using a Random Forest for Virtual Screening
+ Practical 3 ‒ Running a Ligand Based Virtual Screening Experiment using Fingerprints
+ Practical 4 ‒ Seperating actives and decoys using a PCA
