# Introduction to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods

This repository contains a collection of self-explanatory tutorials for different model-agnostic and model-specific XAI methods.
Each tutorial comes in a Jupyter Notebook which contains a short video lecture and practical exercises.

The learning objectives are:

- Understand the importance of interpretability
- Discover some of the existing model-agnostic and model-specific XAI methods
- Learn how to interpret the outputs and graphs of those methods with hands-on exercises
- Learn to choose which method is suitable for a specific task

## Requirements and Setup

It is possible to either create an environment and install all the necessary packages locally (using the requirements.txt file) or to execute the notebooks on the browser, by clicking the 'Open in Colab' button. This second option doesn't require any further installation, but the user must have access to a Google account.
